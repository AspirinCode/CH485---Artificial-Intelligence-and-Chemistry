CH485---Artificial-Intelligence-and-Chemistry wiki!

In this course, CH485 - Artificial Intelligence and Chemistry, students will learn data science for chemical applications. After successfully finishing this course, students will be confident to understand and implement AI models for chemical/molecular applications.

This repository is managed by Seongok Ryu, TA of this course, and lecture notes/example codes about contents treated in the class will be uploaded.
